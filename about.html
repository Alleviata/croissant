    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      According to one of a group of similar legends, which vary only in detail,
      a baker of the 17th century, working through the night at a time when his
      city (either Vienna in 1683 or Budapest in 1686) was under siege by the
      Turks, heard faint underground rumbling sounds which, on investigation,
      proved to be caused by a Turkish attempt to invade the city by tunneling
      under the walls. The tunnel was blown up. The baker asked no reward other
      than the exclusive right to bake crescent-shaped pastries commemorating
      the incident, the crescent being the symbol of Islam. He was duly rewarded
      in this way, and the croissant was born. The story seems to owe its
      origin, or at least its wide diffusion, to Alfred Gottschalk, who wrote
      about the croissant for the first edition [1938] of the Larousse
      Gastronomique and there gave the legend in the Turkish attack on Budapest
      in 1686 version; but on the history of food, opted for the 'siege of
      Vienna in 1683' version.
